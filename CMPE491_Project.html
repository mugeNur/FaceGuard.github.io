        The aim of my project is to develop a computer vision system that can authenticate a person's 
        identity in real-time using a live video feed and their ID photograph. 
        The system will use advanced image processing and machine learning algorithms to extract key features from both the live 
        video and the ID photograph and compare them to determine a match or a mismatch. 
        This system will be used on an online banking platform to enhance security and prevent identity theft. 
        When an user wants to issue a credit card from this online banking application, the face identification system/bot will be 
        activated and if the system verifies, the card application will be received. 
        Now, the user, who is a customer of the bank, can enter the application with facial recognition whenever he wants. 
        In addition, if the user issues an additional card to each of his family members via his credit card, 
        their faces should also be recorded in the system. In this way, other family members who enter the application can view their 
        additional card informations with using facial recognition. Family members can only view informations.

    <ul>
        <li><b>Live face recognition</b></li>
        <p align="justify"> 
            Instead of just comparing static photographs, I’ll use a live video feed to authenticate the user. 
            This will increase security and prevent identity theft. Also, clear and concise instructions will be provided to users on how to 
            use the facial recognition system. For example, the user must be bare face and emotionless, no plastic make-up / heavy make-up can 
            be used. 
        </p>

        <li><b>Multi-factor authentication</b></li>
        <p align="justify">
            I’ll combine the photo matching system with other authentication methods such as a password, security questions, 
            or biometrics to increase security and accuracy.
        </p>

        <li><b>Considering privacy concerns</b></li>
        <p align="justify">
            I will ensure that the system complies with privacy regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA. 
            Additionally, I will design the system to protect users' personal data and prevent unauthorized access.
        </p>
    
        <li><b>In addition,</b></li>
        <p align="justify">
        People who use this banking application will be grouped by gender, age range, nationality(maybe) according to their faces,
        so we will have user statistics and that way, offers for each customer will be personalized.
